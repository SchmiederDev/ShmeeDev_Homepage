                    I like games. Well, millions of people do…<br>
                    And they are right:
                    There is nothing more recreative and enjoyable than the experience of playing a well made game.
                    <br>
                    Not too long ago, I‘ve learned something else about me: Even more than I like playing games,
                    I like making them.
                    To me, nothing sparks more joy than to ponder about new worlds, new stories, new characters,
                    about mechanics and gameplay, how they interact and,
                    of course, to see those worlds come into being eventually.
                    <br>
                    Originally, I am a historian by profession, but my interests and passions
                    have eventually driven me to Game and Software development.
                    At the moment, I am spending all my spare time on learning, coding, developing and writing
                    to become a full-fledged software- and game developer.
                    <br>
                    I hope I can soon put into practice what I‘ve learned so far on a real job,
                    broaden and hone my skills, share thoughts with colleagues and
                    realize larger projects with like minded people, to do what only a team can do.

                A few years ago, I learned the C++ language during a brief pause of my historical work.
                After a few console applications and hard coded Windows-windows in C++,
                I made first experiments coding games using SDL2.
                <br>
                Soon I learned about a miraculous thing called ‚Unity‘.
                I was marveled by the things you could do so (at least seemingly) easily
                and appealing with this engine.
                I created a few one-scene projects experimenting with the capabilities of the engine
                like lighting, collision detection, physics of rigid bodies, animations and animation controllers, camera movement, etc.
                as well as writing scripts to access and control those.
                I coded several types of game/ player controllers to learn about the different possibilities to move characters and vehicles around the scene.
                <br>
                In doing so I learned C# as a newer variant of the C-language-Family.
                <br>
                When I eventually decided that software and game development should become my profession,
                I went on from just experimenting with code and tools as a hobby to serious work on projects
                from start to finish.

                When I started to learn C++/C# properly I experienced something deeply satisfying
                while coding; something you do not have to the same degree in academic work
                (or at least I didn’t): You could see results, immediately.
                <br>
                Of course this wouldn‘t be possible without the help of good documentation,
                people who invest their time in tutorials,
                and a community willing to help out and support each other when they get stuck.
                <br>
                I get stuck often enough.
                But starting to code I experienced another drive which I had not experienced the same way before:
                I didn‘t make me leave my computer in frustration.
                Instead it drove me, I couldn‘t let go – I had to solve the issue!
                <br>
                I enjoy the aspect of analysis and creation.
                This includes breaking down real world structures and processes into abstract units
                of representation and functionality which – combined properly –
                can make people‘s lives easier
                – a user friendly, intuitive arrangement on the GUI given of course.
                Thankfully, this dissection of reality comes to me quite naturally
                because it is a crucial skill of the historian, too, and a well honed one as well.

                This site is about my road to game and software development –
                but it would nigh impossible not to mention my other great love in life: history.
                <br>
                A son of historians I was brought to historical sights very early on.
                Instead of causing utter boredom these ancient buildings, castles and temples
                called pictures of societies long gone into mind and spurred my imagination.
                <br>
                To me history is not a meaningless collection of dusty old papers
                (although I do like the smell of those)
                but a vivid and dynamic transformation process of human societies,
                the sum and amalgamation of human experience.
                Naturally, it was one of my favorite subjects in school.
                <br>
                Since my educational focus had been on languages and the humanities
                it seemed only natural to follow this path further on.
                Long story short: I decided to study history.
                <br>
                After graduation I started applying for jobs, preferably as a museum trainee
                and started to work on a PhD thesis.
                Meanwhile, I also had the opportunity to participate in the creation of two museum exhibitions.
                <br>
                I spare, dear readers, you the details of trying to find a job and earn money as a historian.
                <br>
                Yet, something was gnawing at the corners of my mind.
                Something drew me – almost irresistibly – to switch ‚Visual-Studio‘ and ‚Unity‘ back on again,
                to write and to create.
                I had realized over the course of the recent months
                that I actually wanted to do something else with my life.
                It was dawning on me:
                <br>
                You like to code, You like to create, develop and write stories and concepts.
                You like to delve into other worlds and to develop all kinds of settings.
                You‘re about to get a real grasp of how to combine these elements and how to realize game settings with code and the right tools.
                <br>
                As you can see from these pages: I made a decision.
                It is based not only on long term reflection, but also on a very lucky circumstance:
                I found something even better than a profession: a passion!
                <br>
                Nonetheless I will always be a historically interested person and never stop to be so.

                Knowledge about different human societies will always be a benefit
                when it comes to games with a complex story line and a lot of background lore.
                <br>
                It is a lot easier to ‚invent‘ a society or depict one when you have multiple examples at hand to serve as inspiration.
                <br>
                Acquaintance with the experience of people with different social, cultural and geographical backgrounds
                – and, hopefully, a careful and respectful handling of their testimonia –
                is also an asset for reflecting the diversity of human experience* in games and besides,
                for becoming more attractive for a wider audience.
                <br>
                In short, I think history can be a fountain of inspiration for all kinds of games.
                – Naturally, strategy or fantasy games, but also shooters, simulators or even platformers.
                <br>
                Finally, playing games was almost always a part of the human experience.
                Archaeological findings trace back the use of dice, board games and toys to antiquity and even the stone age.
                What can be more wonderful and stunning than participating in this fundamental human expression of being alive.
                <br>
                Although not all people – maybe not even a lot of them – might see it that way,
                but the creator of games might fulfill a vital function in society:
                serving the need for joy and recreation, enriching the human experience
                and taking care of the human soul.
                <br>
                I hope along my way as a game developer I can one day look back
                and be proud of the circumstance that I might have made some people‘s lives a little nicer.
